# PolynomialRegression
This project practices the use of Polynomial Regression model with one feature—Ages—to predict Insurance Charges.

## Libraries

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn

## Steps in the Practice

1. **Import and Sort Dataset**: Import and sort dataset by ages column.
2. **Train Model**: Use the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn` library to train the Single Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression model using the training set data.
3. **Plot Graph**: Plot graphs for both model.
4. **Single Input Prediction**: Use the regression models to predict a single input compare between Single Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
